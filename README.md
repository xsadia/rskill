**rskill** is clone of [npkill](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill), written in Rust for study purposes. It allows you to quickly find and delete `node_modules` directories to free up disk space. While it tries to follow the same CLI API as `npkill`, it does not implement all of it's features. **User discretion is advised** when deleting directories.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Fast**: Slightly faster than the original `npkill` (though not streamed directly to the terminal and some features are missing such as automatic updates, bg color customization etc.).
- ðŸŽ¯ **Same CLI API**: Supports the same command-line flags as `npkill` for familiarity.
- ðŸ›  **Study Project**: Written in Rust as a learning exercise.
